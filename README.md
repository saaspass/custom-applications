This repo contains the samples that demonstrate the API usage patterns for the SAASPASS Platform. These code samples were created and are designed to run on desktop, server and future devices that support the Java and dotnet SDK.

## Platform development

The dotnet samples require Visual Studio and the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) and the Java samples require the Java Software Development Kit (JDK) >= 1.8 to build, test, and deploy.

## Using the samples

The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the zip file containing the current version (using the following link or by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page).

   **Notes:** 
   * On Windows before you unzip the archive, right-click it, select **Properties**, and then select **Unblock**.
   * Be sure to unzip the entire archive, and not just individual samples.   



For more information about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, please refer to the guidance, tutorials, and reference topics provided in developer documentation available in the [API Reference](https://developers.saaspass.com). These samples are provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for SAASPASS.


## Contributions

These samples are direct from the feature teams and we welcome your input on issues and suggestions for new samples.
